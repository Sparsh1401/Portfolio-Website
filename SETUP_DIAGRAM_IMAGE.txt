🎯 TO COMPLETE THE SETUP - SAVE YOUR DIAGRAM IMAGE
===================================================

Your animated diagram component is ready! Just need to add the image:

OPTION 1: Save from your screenshot (Recommended)
--------------------------------------------------
1. Save the Uber distributed system diagram you showed me
2. Name it: uber-system-diagram.png
3. Move it to: src/assets/uber-system-diagram.png

OPTION 2: If you already have it saved somewhere
------------------------------------------------
Tell me the path and I'll update the code to use it!

OPTION 3: Use a URL (Temporary)
-------------------------------
If you have it hosted online, I can use the URL directly.

Once you save the image, I'll update line 186 in Home.js to:
  imageSrc={require("../assets/uber-system-diagram.png")}

The animation is already working and will show:
✨ Animated data flows through the system
✨ Pulsing service nodes (Kafka, Redis, Spark)
✨ Floating data particles
✨ Green glowing paths matching your portfolio theme

Currently using a placeholder URL that will be replaced with your actual diagram.
